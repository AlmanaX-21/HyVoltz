# HyVoltz

This is a simple API introducing Electricity into the game. The mod works on a Node-Network system. You simply register your nodes with the engine and it handles the rest.

## Nodes

Nodes are the basic unit of electricity. They can be producers, consumers, storage, or connectors. You simply implement the respective interfaces to create your node.

## Network

In simple words, its a graph generator. You register your nodes with the engine for the API to create a network of your nodes. A network is a collection of nodes generated by the engine. It includes all connected nodes.

## Usage Example

```java
// In your BlockComponent
HyVoltzNodeComponent powerNode = new HyVoltzNodeComponent(new MyGeneratorNode());

// Attach when block is placed/loaded
powerNode.attach(world.getUuid(), blockPos);

// In your tick loop, logic runs automatically
// HyVoltz moves power from Producers -> Consumers
```
